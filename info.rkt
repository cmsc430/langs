;; Outlaw is omitted here because it depends on libraries that are a pain
;; to ensure are set up properly and we don't want students to see failing
;; tests at the beginning of the semester, nor do we want to get into
;; setting up libraries only needed in the last week and only if you
;; actually care to run Outlaw.

;; To test outlaw you should do an explicit: raco test -c outlaw
